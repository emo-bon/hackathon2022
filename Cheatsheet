## Just a few notes on LINUX/UNIX commands you will need...

`ls ` - list directory contents
`ls -al` - list directory contents and file permissions, sizes etc
`mv <name1> <name2>` - if <name1> is a file, and <name2> is not a directory, <name1> will be renamed to <name2>
                     - if <name1> is a file, and <name2> is a directory, <name1> will be more into the directory <name2>
                     - if <name1> is a directory, and <name2> is a directory, <name2> directory will be moved into directory <name2>
`cp <name1> <name2>` - copy <name1> to <name2>
`mkdir <name>` - make a directory named <name>
`scp <source> <destination>` - secure copy (between machines) a source file or directory to a destination directory
  e.g. `scp <user1>@machine1.domain.com:~/<file1> .` - secure copy the file named <file1> in the /home directory of the user named <user1> on the computer at the DNS address `machine1.domain.com` to the curent directory `.` (period specifies the current directory the command is being issued in)
